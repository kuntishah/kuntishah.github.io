<h4>HabitAid - iOS App</h4>

<h4>Class TM - iOS and Android App</h4>

<p><b>Problem:</b> World Intellectual Property Organization has a list of goods and services under NICE Classification. The list has CLASS 1 to 45, wherein 1-34 CLASS belongs to GOODS and 35-45 CLASS belongs to SERVICES. Information in these classes helps people and companies identify under which class their goods and services fall into. 

</p>

<p>To get this information one has either use website or download a pdf and it tedious to find under which </p>

<br>

<p>

<b>Solution:</b> An Android app which allows to query which goods and services are present in which CLASS would be really helpful.

</p>

<br><p><b>Explanation:</b>The NICE classification is updated yearly and so is the app. CLASS TM, allows user to search any good or service. Upon searching for such information the app returns list of classes under which the searched goods or services belong. For e.g. if user searches for rope, rope could belong in more than one class depending upon usage of the rope. User can click on any class from the result list and a screen will open with all the information about a specific class. If user goes back the result list will remain and you can navigate up and down the list to search for other classes. This app has helped many Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) lawyers to search for correct category. IPR lawyers often need correct classification of goods/services instantly and they may not have internet access. They also need to verify the class they want to file the product under. This App allows them to access all classification information in offline manner and instantly which saves them a lot of time.

<h4>Selenium Code</h4>

<h5>Personal Project</h5>

<p>Written Selenium WebDriver code in Java. Used Hybrid framework with Page Object repository and Data Driven Testing framework.<p>

<ul>

<li>Used TestNG to create and run tests. Also used to pass parameters with dataprovider, profiling of test cases and run test cases in parallel. 

TestNG reports give clear understanding of pass/fail status of test cases.</li>

<li>Used Maven to manage dependencies. Update pom.xml with all the dependencies.</li>

<li>Used Log4j to help debug. Helps to look at logs while debugging. Can log on console or in file.</li>

<li>Used Microsoft excel for creating data for tests. Specific functions are written to get and set data in excel</li>

<h4>Automated Information Extraction tool</h4>

<h5>Personal Project</h5>

<p><b>Problem:</b> World Intellectual Property Organization has a list of goods and services under NICE Classification. The list has CLASS 1 to 45, wherein 1-34 CLASS belongs to GOODS and 35-45 CLASS belongs to SERVICES. Information in these classes helps people and companies identify under which class 

their goods and services fall into so that they can file their patent under right CLASS.

</p>

<p>To get this information one has either use website or download a pdf and it tedious to find under which class the goods or service belongs. A database on which one could query such information would make the task much easier.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Solution:</b> Manually saving this information in excel sheet is tedious. This information is changes / updates yearly and every year the CLASS numbers remain same. Therefore, I wrote Python scripts to extract and transform goods and services information for each class and then load it into a database.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Explanation:</b> There are two Python programs:

<ul>

<li>First program retrieves and saves all the CLASS html webpages to disk. </li>

<li>Second program extracts the details of each class , goods and services. This data is then saved into a database from where it can browsed and queried.</li>
