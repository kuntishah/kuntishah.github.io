<h4>Automated Information Extraction tool</h4>
<h5>Personal Project</h5>
<p><b>Problem:</b> World Intellectual Property Organization has a list of goods and services under NICE Classification. The list has CLASS 1 to 45, wherein 1-34 CLASS belongs to GOODS and 35-45 CLASS belongs to SERVICES. Information in these classes helps people and companies identify under which class 
their goods and services fall into so that they can file their patent under right CLASS.
</p>
<p>To get this information one has either use website or download a pdf and it tedious to find under which class the goods or service belongs. A database on which one could query such information would make the task much easier.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Solution:</b> Manually saving this information in excel sheet is tedious. This information is changes / updates yearly and every year the CLASS numbers remain same. Therefore, I wrote Python scripts to extract and transform goods and services information for each class and then load it into a database.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Explanation:</b> There are two Python programs:
<ul>
<li>First program retrieves and saves all the CLASS html webpages to disk. </li>
<li>Second program extracts the details of each class , goods and services. This data is then saved into a database from where it can browsed and queried.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Class TM - Android App</h4>

Information in these classes helps people and companies identify under which class their goods and services fall into.

<br>
<p>
<b>Solution:</b> An Android app which allows to query which goods and services are present in which CLASS would be really helpful.
</p>
<br><p><b>Explanation:</b> The NICE classification information from website is saved in a static database. The NICE classification is updated yearly hence the database does need to be updated on regular basis. The Android app, CLASS TM, allows user to search any good or service. Upon searching for such information the app returns list of classes under which the searched goods or services belong. For e.g. if I search for rope, rope could belong in more than one class depending upon usage of the rope. You can click on any class from the result list and a screen will open with all the information about a specific class. If you go back the result list will remain and you can navigate up and down the list to search for other classes. This app has helped many Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) lawyers to search for correct category. IPR lawyers often need correct classification of goods/services instantly and they may not have internet access. This Android App allows them to access all classification information in offline manner and instantly. IPR lawyers need to verify the class they want to file the product under and this app saves a lot of time. There have been more than 100 installs of this app from various countries.
